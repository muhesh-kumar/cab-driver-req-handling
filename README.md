The Need for Choosing the 'Right' Requests is very crucial since most drivers in any
big town or city get a healthy number of ride requests from customers throughout the
day. But with the recent hikes in fuel prices, many drivers complain that although
their revenues are gradually increasing, their profits are almost flat. Thus, it is
important that drivers choose the 'right' rides, i.e., choose the rides which are likely to
maximize the total profit earned by the driver that day.

For example, say a driver gets three ride requests at 5 PM. The first one is a long-
distance ride guaranteeing high fare, but it will take him to a location which is
unlikely to get him another ride for the next few hours. The second one ends in a
better location, but it requires him to take a slight detour to pick the customer up,
adding to fuel costs. Perhaps the best choice is to choose the third one, which
although is medium-distance, it will likely get him another ride subsequently and
avoid most of the traffic. Considering this factor our AI agent will help cab drivers pick
up the best request at any time they are free.
